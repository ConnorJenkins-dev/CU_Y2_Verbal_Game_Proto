('Opening.mp3','opening.jpg', 'Smoke curls through the hallways of the imperial palace, thick and choking, as fires cast long, flickering shadows across the shoji screens. Shadows dance over the pillars of the throne room, where you kneel at the heart of your family’s empire. Your throat burns with every breath, and the stone floor beneath your knees feels cold and unyielding despite the surrounding heat. Beside you, your father, Emperor Kiyohito, lies bound, his face bloodied but still defiant. Your mother kneels at his side, her pale face streaked with tears. All around you, samurai stand in an unyielding circle, their armour glowing red in the firelight, swords drawn, faces unreadable. They form an impenetrable wall, trapping what remains of your family. At the centre of it all stands the Shogun, a man you once called “uncle.” His towering frame is cloaked in black armour that swallows the light, his presence heavier than the smoke filling the room. His eyes, once warm with familiarity, now burn cold and unrelenting. “For generations, the samurai have defended Japan,” the Shogun declares, his voice cutting through the crackling flames. “We have stood against corruption, against weakness.” His gaze shifts to your father, piercing and accusing. “And yet you, Emperor Kiyohito, sought to unravel that. You would strip us of our power, break the honour of the samurai, and leave Japan vulnerable.” The Shogun’s voice grows harder, his tone laden with venom. “You, who I once revered as a father, who I once stood beside as a brother—you have betrayed us all!” He steps forward, his hand resting on the hilt of his katana. “And for that, you shall suffer.” Your mother’s hand tightens around yours, her trembling fingers the only anchor you have. Her grip is firm, though she shakes with fear. She leans toward you, her voice barely above a whisper. “Endure… whatever you must…” Her words die in her throat as the Shogun unsheathes his katana in a smooth, practiced motion. The blade gleams with deadly intent, and he turns toward her. “No!” you cry, your voice small and powerless. The strike is merciless. The blade pierces her chest, and she gasps, her breath faltering as her body slumps forward. Her blood pools on the stone floor, dark and spreading, and her hand slips from yours. She looks at you with eyes full of pain and love, her lips trembling as she forms her final words. “S...save… y-yours…” Her body collapses, lifeless, and the world seems to freeze. Through the roaring flames and the pounding of your heart, you hear it: a baby’s cry. Your brother’s cry. Somewhere in the chaos, beyond the inferno and the bloodshed, he is still alive. The Shogun steps closer to your father, his expression hard and unfeeling. “Look upon the remains of your family, Kiyohito,” he sneers. “This is the future you would have brought upon Japan. Chaos. Destruction. To purify the garden, one must cut away the weeds that poison it.” Your father lifts his head, his face battered but his spirit unbroken. “A weed,” he says, his voice filled with quiet strength, “is only a plant one has not deemed fit for the garden. And your judgment… is unworthy of Japan.” The Shogun’s eyes narrow, and his hand tightens on his sword. “And so, your bloodline shall perish,” he says coldly. “With the death of this so-called Emperor, Japan’s dawn shall rise unclouded.” As he raises his katana to deliver the final blow, your eyes fall to something glinting beside your mother’s lifeless body. A tanto—a small dagger, the hilt stained with blood where her hand had gripped it. You reach out, your fingers trembling as they close around the cold steel. Your father’s voice suddenly cuts through the chaos, raw and desperate. “Hashire!” he cries, turning his fierce gaze to you. “Run, my son! Run!” The world blurs as you spring to your feet, the dagger firm in your grasp. A samurai moves to restrain you, but with a surge of desperation, you drive the blade into his eye. His howl of pain echoes through the chamber as he stumbles back, releasing you. The firelight dances wildly around you as you break free. Ahead, the palace doors stand open, leading into the burning courtyard. Behind you, the baby’s cries echo faintly, pulling at your heart. The flames crackle louder, and the palace begins to collapse. Your feet hesitate, torn between fleeing and turning back. Your brother’s cry grows fainter, muffled by the inferno. The choice is yours. Do you run for your life or risk everything to save him?', 1, 2, 3),
('Run.mp3','Run.jpg', 'The palace erupts in chaos, flames consuming its once-pristine halls as the crackling inferno roars like an angry kami. You turn from the sight of your mother’s lifeless body, your young mind reeling, your heart screaming at you to run. Smoke fills your lungs as you sprint down the grand staircase, tears carving clean tracks through the soot staining your face. Behind you, the shouts of pursuing samurai echo, their armour clattering and the sharp cracks of tanegashima rifles splitting the air. Bullets tear through the smoky haze, splintering wood and shattering stone as you dart between pillars and the wreckage of fallen servants. Your bare feet barely touch the ground as you reach the lower steps of the shomen genkan, the main entrance. Ahead, crates and barrels are stacked carelessly in the panic of fleeing workers. Without thinking, you dive behind them, your small body pressing into the splintered wood as your pursuers bark commands. Your breaths come fast and shallow, your trembling hands clutching the splintered edge of the crate. Beside you, sprawled on the ground, lies the lifeless body of a palace servant. His blood pools in the dirt, staining the floor in dark red. Your eyes catch on the short blade clutched in his hand—a wakizashi, faintly glinting even through the smoke-choked gloom. You reach for it, your fingers wrapping around the hilt. It feels lighter than you expect, the grip foreign in your small hands but familiar all the same. This is your father’s blade. You know it instantly. Then your gaze shifts. In the servant’s other hand is something strange—a cylindrical object wrapped in oiled paper, a thin fuse trailing from its top. Your chest tightens as you take in the crates surrounding you. Faded markings scrawled in kanji read “high explosives” (bakuyaku). Time seems to freeze, the heat of the flames pressing against your back as the realization sets in. “There he is!” a voice shouts, snapping you back to the moment. Your heart skips. You can’t stay. Clutching the wakizashi and the strange cylinder, you bolt from your hiding spot toward the great gates of the palace. “The crates—stop him before—” The explosion drowns out the words, a deafening roar that shakes the earth. You’re thrown forward as the blast sends fire and debris spiralling into the night sky. For an instant, you’re weightless, suspended in the air as the shockwave carries you like a fallen leaf in a storm. Then, with a sickening jolt, you crash into the jungle below the palace, the hard earth knocking the wind from your lungs. When you come to, your head is pounding, your vision blurry. The cool dampness of the forest floor soothes your bruised body as you push yourself upright, groaning at the pain in your ribs. The fiery glow of the palace burns in the distance, faint through the dense canopy above. Your fingers tighten instinctively around the wakizashi, now streaked with soot but still intact. But your other hand is empty—the strange cylinder lost in the chaos. You shift, and your breath catches. A figure lies just meters away, sprawled on the ground. A samurai. His armour is dented, his helmet missing, and blood seeps from a deep wound in his side. He’s alive, barely. The samurai stirs, coughing weakly. His eyes open and lock onto yours. For a moment, recognition flickers in his gaze. “Wait... boy…” he rasps, his voice broken and faint. “I… I can help you. If you kill me—” But his words mean nothing to you. They dissolve into the smoke-filled memories of your mother’s last breath, your father’s defiance, and the cold, cruel eyes of the shogun. Anger rises in your chest, burning hotter than the flames that destroyed your home. Your vision blurs with tears, your small hands trembling as they tighten around the wakizashi. “Yamero!” the samurai cries, but it’s too late. With a scream of fury, you lunge forward, the blade driving deep into his chest. The samurai gasps, his eyes widening in shock as blood spills over your hands. His body twitches once, then goes still. Silence falls, heavy and suffocating. You stumble back, your breath coming in sharp, ragged gasps. The blade slips from your grasp, falling to the blood-soaked ground. Your hands are slick and trembling, your heart pounding as the weight of what you’ve done crashes over you. You’ve taken a life. The sound of hooves snaps you from your daze. Your head whips toward the noise. Faint figures on horseback appear through the trees, their shapes shifting in the moonlit shadows. You can’t tell if they’re samurai or hunters, and you don’t wait to find out. Your legs move before your mind catches up, carrying you deeper into the forest. Each step sends sharp jolts of pain through your battered body, but fear keeps you moving. The jungle stretches endlessly before you, its ancient trees towering like silent sentinels. Finally, after what feels like hours, you emerge onto a narrow dirt road leading to a small fishing port. The scent of salt and fish fills the air, mingling with the faint, acrid tang of smoke clinging to your clothes. The docks are alive with movement—merchants shouting, workers loading crates onto a large ship. Its sails are marked with foreign symbols, the language of lands you’ve only heard whispered about. You slip into the crowd unnoticed, your bloodstained royal robes hidden beneath layers of soot and grime. The ship’s crew doesn’t notice as you climb into the hull, tucking yourself among the sacks of grain. You sit in the shadows, clutching your father’s wakizashi, its weight now a constant reminder of what you’ve lost—and what you’ve done. You are no longer Aiko, son of the emperor. You are no longer a prince. You are no one. As the ship’s sails catch the wind and the port fades into the distance, you stare into the horizon. The air grows cooler, the waves lapping softly against the hull. Vengeance burns quietly in your chest. Your journey has only begun.', 2, 4, 4),
('Save.mp3','Save.jpg', 'The flames roar louder, licking at the ceiling and walls of the crumbling palace. Your small feet struggle to find steady purchase on the blood-slicked stone floor as you run through the chaos. The inferno’s heat claws at your back, singeing your hair, but you push forward, driven by a desperation that burns hotter than the fire itself. Each breath scorches your lungs, filling them with smoke, the coppery tang of blood mixing with the sharp, acrid stench of burning wood. Behind you, the clanking of samurai armour grows louder, their relentless pursuit echoing through the hallways. They are closing in, their heavy footsteps a predator’s growl, but you are quicker, lighter, slipping through the destruction like a shadow. All that fills your mind is one name. “Taka!” you cry, your voice cracking as it fights to rise above the roar of the blaze. Your brother’s name carries into the smoke, your heart hammering as you search desperately. At last, you burst into the training hall, a vast room where echoes of your family’s legacy linger in the wooden walls. Now, it is almost entirely consumed by the fire, its timbers groaning under the heat. In the corner, wrapped tightly in cloth, you see him—Taka, fragile and helpless. His faint cries pierce through the chaos. You rush forward, falling to your knees as you scoop him into your arms. His tiny body feels impossibly light, his breaths warm against your neck. Relief washes over you, but it is fleeting. You glance around, searching for a way out, and your eyes catch on a glint of metal in the flames: your father’s katana, its hilt glowing red-hot from the heat. Your hand trembles as you reach for it, the heat searing into your palm the moment you touch it. You grit your teeth, tears welling in your eyes, but you refuse to let go. The blade feels impossibly heavy, yet it is your only chance. The sound of footsteps pulls your attention. Two samurai emerge from the smoke, their faces obscured by helmets, their swords gleaming coldly in the flickering light. You clutch Taka tighter, your heart pounding in your ears as they approach. But before they can reach you, the ceiling above them gives way with a deafening crash. A massive wooden beam splinters and falls, crushing them beneath its weight. You stagger to your feet, your muscles screaming in protest, but there is no time to rest. Another pair of samurai appear in the doorway, their swords raised, their eyes locked on you. “Little rat,” one growls, his voice low and menacing. “You have nowhere to run.” You glance around, the flames closing in from all sides. Your gaze lands on a small window high above the ground, your only escape. But first, the samurai. Gritting your teeth, you lift the katana, its hilt still scorching against your blistered palm. With a cry born of pain and rage, you swing the blade. It connects, slicing through the first samurai’s armour and deep into his belly. His eyes widen in shock as he stumbles backward, collapsing to the floor in a pool of blood. The second samurai hesitates, but you don’t wait. With Taka cradled against your chest, you turn and sprint toward the window. Your body aches, every step sending jolts of pain through your legs, but you force yourself forward. You leap, the world blurring as you crash through the thin wooden frame. Air rushes past you, the jungle below rushing up to meet you. Branches snag at your clothes, scratching and tearing as you tumble through the trees. You hit the ground hard, the impact knocking the breath from your lungs. For a moment, everything fades into darkness. When you open your eyes, the world is quiet. The rising sun filters through the jungle canopy, its soft light a stark contrast to the fiery nightmare you left behind. Bruised and battered, your hand throbs with a deep, searing pain. You sit up slowly, clutching at the cloth where Taka had been, but your arms are empty. Panic surges through you as you scramble to your feet, searching the underbrush with wild eyes. “Taka!” you shout, your voice hoarse and cracking. There’s no response, only the rustle of leaves and the distant calls of birds. Your legs feel like lead, but you stumble forward, calling his name again and again. Hours pass, or perhaps it’s only minutes—it’s impossible to tell. Exhaustion weighs you down, and eventually, you collapse against a tree, your breath coming in shallow gasps. Then, a sound breaks through the silence: the rhythmic clop of hooves. Horses. You freeze, your heart leaping into your throat. Figures on horseback appear in the distance, their outlines hazy through the trees. You don’t wait to see who they are. Your body moves on instinct, pushing through the foliage toward the faint sound of waves. At the edge of the jungle, a bustling harbour comes into view. Ships are docked along the pier, their crews shouting orders as they load crates of grain and goods. You blend into the crowd, shedding your charred, bloodstained robes and letting them fall into the water. Beneath them, the dirty rags you wear make you look like any other beggar. You are no longer a prince. You are no longer the heir to an empire. You are a boy alone in a world that doesn’t know you exist. Your eyes scan the ships, searching for one bound for anywhere far away. You spot a merchant vessel, its sails billowing as the crew prepares to depart. Without hesitation, you slip into a crate of grain, the heavy sacks pressing down on you as you hide. The ship’s deck creaks above you as it begins to move, the sound of waves lapping against its hull. The sails catch the wind, and the port fades into the distance. You lie in the darkness, clutching the katana to your chest, your mind racing with thoughts of Taka, of the family you’ve lost, of the empire now in ashes. Once, you were a prince. Now, you are a nameless boy bound for a foreign land, where a new life awaits. And so, your journey begins.', 2, 4, 4),
('Continue.mp3', 'continue.jpg', 'Years have passed since you left Japan, and now, in the dusty frontier town of Rustwater, California, you sit nursing a bourbon in the dim light of the saloon. The midday sun pierces through the cracks in the warped roof and the swinging saloon doors, casting golden streaks on the worn floorboards. The air inside is thick with the scents of stale liquor, cigar smoke, and the faint hint of perfume from the painted ladies idling on the staircase. George, the town pianist, plays a meandering tune on the out-of-tune upright piano in the corner. A handful of patrons lounge at tables, swapping stories over beers, their voices blending with the occasional laugh or shout from outside. Beside you, Silas—a relic of the Old West’s wilder days—slumps over the bar, clutching a half-empty bottle of whiskey. A cigarette burns low between his fingers, threatening to scorch the knotted wood beneath. You glance at him and sigh. “Think he’s finally croaked?” Maeve O’Hanlon, the saloon’s owner and bartender, asks as she emerges from the cellar with a fresh keg. Her auburn hair glows in the sunlight, and her Irish lilt is sharp as a whip. “Maybe,” you mutter, nudging Silas with your elbow. He doesn’t budge, and with a groan, he slides off the stool, hitting the ground with an unceremonious thud. Maeve leans over the bar with a concerned look, and you both peer down at him. For a moment, the saloon grows quiet, save for George’s playing and the faint buzz of flies. Then Silas lets out a loud, hog-like snore, startling a laugh out of Maeve. “Well, he’s not dead yet,” you mutter, climbing down from your stool. You nudge Silas’s boot with your own. “Get up, old man.” Maeve crosses her arms as Silas jolts awake in a panic, his hand instinctively reaching for the empty holster at his hip. It’s a reflex he hasn’t entirely shaken, even though his gunslinging days are long behind him. “You’re drooling on my floor again,” Maeve scolds, her tone more exasperated than angry. “Apologies, Miss O’Hanlon,” Silas drawls as you help him back to his feet. He sways unsteadily and grins like a repentant child. “It’s Friday night. Can you find it in your heart to forgive me?” Maeve rolls her eyes and waves him off as she turns to pour a beer for another patron. “It’s Tuesday,” you say flatly, sitting back down and taking a slow sip of your drink. “And it’s noon.” Silas rubs his temples and groans. “Really? Well, time flies when you’re havin’ fun.” He tips his bottle back to drain the last few drops and shakes it with disappointment. “Maeve, how about one more for the road, darlin’?” “You’ve had enough ‘ones for the road’ to get to New York and back,” she snaps without turning around. Silas sighs and fishes a cigarette from his pocket, lighting it with hands that shake only slightly. He takes a long drag and exhales a plume of smoke before turning to you. “How’s work treatin’ you, son?” You shrug. “Brought in three bounties before sunrise, four before lunch.” “Seven before noon?” Silas chuckles, slapping the bar with his palm. “Hell, you’re givin’ the Dunn Brothers a run for their money. Where’d you learn to shoot like that?” You smirk, pouring a splash of your whiskey into his empty bottle. “From the best, Silas. From the best.” Before he can respond, the saloon doors creak open with a heavy kick, and the lively hum of the room dies instantly. Like clockwork, every head swivels toward the entrance. A figure stands silhouetted against the midday sun, hands on his hips. The light casts him in shadow, but as he steps forward, his features come into focus—a lean, mean-looking man with a stubbly jaw and a shiny deputy’s badge pinned to his waistcoat. His boots scuff against the floorboards as he surveys the room with a self-satisfied smirk. “Ike O’Hanlon,” he calls, his voice loud and cutting. You sigh and take another swig of your drink before answering. “Yes, Deputy Cole?” The deputy’s jaw tightens at your tone, his smirk faltering for a fraction of a second. He doesn’t like you much, and the feeling is mutual. “Sheriff wants you,” he says tersely. You glance at Silas, who raises an eyebrow and takes a puff of his cigarette. Maeve sets down a glass with a sharp clink and leans on the bar, her eyes darting between you and the deputy. “Well, Ike?” Silas mutters under his breath. “You goin’, or you gonna make him sweat a little?”', 2, 5, 6),
('Follow.mp3', 'Follow.jpeg', 'With a sigh, you rise from your stool, grabbing the sheathed sword leaning by the bar—a relic of your father’s, polished but showing its years. The steel feels solid on your back as you sling it into place, its worn leather grip resting comfortably near your shoulder. Adjusting your hat against the glare of the midday sun streaming through the saloon’s windows, you glance at Cole with a wry smirk. “All right, Cole,” you say, your voice carrying a note of mockery, “let’s see what the sheriff needs done that he doesn’t trust you with.” A ripple of laughter passes through the bar. Maeve shakes her head at the exchange, her sharp green eyes narrowing as if to warn you not to push too far. The patrons’ amusement fades quickly when Cole’s scowl sweeps the room, his hand brushing the butt of his revolver. With a low growl, he jerks his head toward the door. You step out onto the saloon porch, the dry heat of the California sun bearing down on you. Dust swirls lazily across the empty main street, kicked up by the faint wind. Rustwater looks like a ghost town under the unforgiving drought, the usual midday bustle replaced by silence save for the distant creak of a water pump and the occasional bark of a dog. You fall into step behind Cole, his boots thudding against the cracked earth. He doesn’t speak, and neither do you. What could you talk about, anyway? The man’s disdain for you is palpable. As the dilapidated jailhouse comes into view, its faded sign hanging askew, you hear raised voices from within. Ascending the rickety steps, you cross paths with the mayor, his polished shoes clashing with the grime of the frontier town. He spares you a brief, anxious look before hurrying past, his face pale and drawn. Inside, Sheriff Malone leans back in his creaking chair, the midday light slanting across his weathered features. His wide-brimmed hat sits low on his forehead, but his sharp blue eyes still manage to meet yours. “Ah, Mr. O’Hanlon,” Malone says with a broad grin. “Just the man I wanted to see. Fine work with those moonshiners this morning.” He gestures to the chair across from him. You remain standing. “Sheriff Malone,” you reply with respect, though your tone is edged with curiosity. “The deputy said it was urgent?” “Indeed.” Malone leans forward, elbows resting on his cluttered desk. “We’ve got intel from the Pinkerton Detective Agency. The Jenkins gang is planning to rob stages down by Silverbelly Creek. Big news—they think David Jenkins himself is leading it.” The name tightens your chest. “David Jenkins?” you ask, incredulous. “The man’s a ghost. We’ve been chasing shadows for years. What makes the Pinkertons so sure?” Malone leans back, the chair groaning under his weight. “Can we trust the Pinkertons? Probably not. But it’s the best lead we’ve had in years. You interested in taking the bounty?”', 3, 7, 8),
('Wait.mp3','Wait.jpg',  'You swirl the bourbon in your glass before taking another long sip. “I’m on my break, Deputy. Tell the sheriff I’ll be there later.” Cole stiffens, his posture going ramrod straight. “I’m a deputy, not a messenger boy, O’Hanlon,” he snaps, his tone rising above the murmur of the saloon. You cock your head and smirk, setting your drink down with a soft clink. “Then what are you here for? Arrest someone, or deliver a message?” Laughter ripples through the room, drawing amused glances from patrons and a smirk from Silas, who leans back in his chair, clearly enjoying the exchange. Cole’s face darkens, and he takes a step closer. “Very funny,” he growls. “Maybe I’ll drag you in myself.” You let out a booming laugh, leaning back casually against the bar. “Well, I’m honoured you’d want me to be your first.” The saloon erupts with laughter this time, and even Maeve, leaning on the counter nearby, allows herself a small smirk before fixing you with a disappointed glare. Her look says everything—it’s beneath you to antagonize the deputy. Cole’s nostrils flare, but he doesn’t rise to the bait. Instead, he steps closer, lowering his voice to a tense whisper. “It’s urgent, Ike. Sheriff wouldn’t have sent me otherwise.” You sigh, glancing at Maeve, whose steady gaze seems to say, Do the right thing. You tip your hat slightly to her, acknowledging her silent reproach. “All right, I’m coming,” you mutter. Rising from your stool, you grab your father’s sword from its place by the bar and sling it onto your back. With a final swig of bourbon, you adjust your hat and step out into the harsh sunlight alongside Cole. The bright sun blinds you for a moment as you step out from the saloon’s shaded porch. The heat is oppressive, baking the dusty main street until the air shimmers. Rustwater is eerily quiet for this time of day. The drought has driven most folks to their fields, working desperately to salvage what little they can of their crops. A dog trots lazily across the street, its tongue lolling out in the heat. Cole walks ahead, his boots kicking up small puffs of dirt with each step. His silence is stony, his gaze fixed ahead. The distance between you and him feels less like an escort and more like a chasm of mutual disdain. As you approach the jailhouse, its sun-bleached timbers seem ready to crumble under the weight of another dry summer. Voices drift through the open windows, heated and overlapping. Ascending the rickety steps, you catch sight of the mayor, his face tight with worry. He gives you a brief, uncertain nod before brushing past, muttering something under his breath. Inside, Sheriff Malone stands behind his desk, his chair pushed back as if he’s just leapt to his feet. The cluttered surface is covered with wanted posters, a ledger, and a battered revolver. His sharp gaze fixes on you as you enter. “Ah, Mr. O’Hanlon,” he says, a note of approval in his gruff voice. “Glad you came. Damn fine work with those moonshiners this morning.” “Sheriff,” you reply with a slight nod. “Deputy said it was urgent?” Malone gestures for you to step closer. “We’ve got word from the Pinkertons. The Jenkins gang is planning to hit stages down by Silverbelly Creek. And here’s the big news—David Jenkins himself might be leading it.” The name lands like a blow. “David Jenkins?” Your tone sharpens. “You’re sure? The man’s been in hiding for years. Why now?” “We’re not sure,” Malone admits, sitting down heavily. “But it’s our best lead in years. If you trust the Pinkertons to do this right, you can head back to the saloon. Otherwise…” He leaves the sentence hanging. The decision is yours—take the bounty yes, or no?', 3, 7, 8),
('NoBounty.mp3','noBounty.jpg', 'You shake your head. “No thanks, Sheriff. I’ll leave this one to them.” The room falls silent. Even Cole looks stunned, his usual sneer replaced by wide-eyed disbelief. Sheriff Malone leans back in his chair, his face unreadable. “Suit yourself,” Malone mutters, but there’s a weight to his voice—disappointment, maybe, or resignation. You tip your hat, turning on your heel and striding out of the jailhouse, the heavy weight of your father’s sword tapping lightly against your back. As you step into the dusty streets of Rustwater, the sun seems harsher than before, the emptiness of the town sinking into your chest. The days blur into weeks, and the weeks into months. Life continues much as it always has—tracking bounties, collecting pay, returning to the saloon to drown in bourbon and half-remembered regrets. But the news trickles in, piece by piece: the Jenkins gang, emboldened, terrorizes towns from San Diego to San Francisco. The Pinkertons bungle their pursuit, and David Jenkins vanishes once more into the shadows of infamy. And then, the mining company arrives. Wealthy investors with more money than decency buy Rustwater out from under its people, forcing families from their homes and businesses. The saloon shutters its doors. Even Maeve leaves, her whereabouts unknown. You spend the next years wandering—taking odd jobs, chasing fleeting leads, and feeling the pull of time weigh heavier on your shoulders. It isn’t the bullets or brawls that get you in the end, but an illness that creeps through your body, leaving you frail and alone in some nameless town. No family, no legacy—just a faded photograph of Rustwater in your pocket and the faint echo of a life that could have been. The End.', 1, 1, 1),
('YesBounty.mp3','yesbounty.jpg', 'Your jaw tightens as the Sheriff finishes speaking. “No shot I’m leaving this to those incompetent union oppressors,” you snap, your voice brimming with determination. “Jenkins is mine.” Without waiting for a reply, you spin on your heel and head out the door, your boots clomping heavily against the wooden planks of the porch. Stepping into the blazing sun, you let out a sharp, piercing whistle that cuts through the desolate silence of the town. A thunder of hooves answers your call as Barkley, your loyal bay stallion, barrels down the street. Dust swirls in his wake as he comes to a skidding halt before you, his chestnut coat shimmering with sweat under the noonday sun. With a practiced motion, you grab the saddle horn and swing up onto his back, the leather creaking beneath your weight. Barkley rears on command, letting out a powerful neigh that echoes down the street. Behind you, the Sheriff steps onto the porch, his expression grim but approving. “Give ’em hell, son,” he calls. You tip your hat, spurring Barkley forward. The horse surges ahead, hooves pounding against the dry earth as you ride out of Rustwater, the town shrinking behind you under the unforgiving sun. Hours pass as you ride the dusty trail south, the barren landscape giving way to the dense greenery of Silverbelly Creek’s outskirts. Shadows grow longer as the forest closes in, the cool shade a welcome reprieve from the desert heat. But it isn’t peace you find here. The sharp smell of gunpowder and blood pricks your nose as you approach the trailhead. Two corpses lie crumpled on the ground, dressed in black suits, red waistcoats, and bowler hats. Pinkertons. Their faces are twisted in death, mouths open in silent protest, revolvers still holstered. They didn’t even have a chance. Your eyes sweep the area, taking in the details. The dirt is churned with fresh hoofprints—more than a dozen horses, by the look of it. Wagon wheel ruts cut deep into the trail, leading further into the forest. You dismount, crouching near the tracks, your fingers brushing the dirt. “Damn amateurs,” you mutter. The Pinkertons were out of their depth, and now it’s up to you to finish the job. The question is, how? The tracks lead deeper into the woods, where the canopy grows thicker and shadows dance ominously. But the main road continues south, winding toward the open plains. Following the tracks might mean catching the gang unaware—or walking straight into an ambush. Staying on the road offers safety, but it might cost you the element of surprise. Will you follow the tracks or the road?', 4, 9, 10),
('Tracks.mp3','tracks.jpg', 'You guide Barkley off the road and deeper into the forest, the wagon tracks leading you through thick underbrush and over uneven terrain. The fading sun filters through the canopy, casting the woods in a flickering mosaic of light and shadow. The air grows cool, heavy with the smell of damp earth and pine. The only sounds are the rustling leaves and the faint snap of twigs as small creatures scurry out of your path. Then, in the distance, you spot it: a flickering orange glow against the darkening sky, accompanied by a thin column of smoke rising into the air. Barkley slows to a cautious trot as you near the source. You dismount just beyond the clearing, tying him to a sturdy tree and patting his flank to keep him calm. Peering through the brush, you survey the camp. Four stagecoaches lie scattered around, their doors hanging open and their hulls riddled with bullet holes. Splintered trunks and boxes spill their contents onto the dirt—clothes, papers, shattered bottles. By the fire, a scruffy man sways drunkenly, singing a slurred rendition of some old tune as he waves a bottle in the air. Nearby, another man crouches, meticulously sorting jewelry and gold coins into saddlebags. Standing at the edge of the camp, a third man grips a repeater, his eyes scanning the surrounding woods. They’re rough-looking, their clothes worn thin and stained, their faces pale and sickly—Jenkins’ boys, no doubt. This must be their stash, the spoils of their latest raid. If David Jenkins himself is nearby, it’ll be deeper in the forest. You take a deep breath, your hand brushing the hilt of your father’s sword strapped to your back. These men are amateurs, but even amateurs can kill if you’re not careful. Will you choose to rush in or sneak?', 5, 11, 12),
('Road.mp3','road.jpg', 'You steer Barkley back onto the open trail, the forest thinning as you near the base of Mount de Lobo. The landmark looms ahead, its jagged cliffs and weathered ridges casting long shadows across the dusty landscape. The road curves around the mountain, winding toward the open plains and the promise of Silverbelly Creek. But your attention is drawn to something else—a dark opening in the mountain’s face, yawning like the maw of a beast. The old train tunnel. It’s been years since the railway abandoned this stretch, the tracks long since pulled up, but the tunnel remains, a shortcut through the mountain that could shave hours off your journey. The entrance is weathered and overgrown, its stone arch blackened with soot from years past. The air around it feels cooler, almost damp, and a faint echo reverberates from within, as if the mountain itself is breathing. You glance at the fading sunlight dipping below the peak. Time is slipping away. The open road is safer, with a clear path and a good line of sight, but it’ll take longer. The tunnel is a gamble—it could save you precious hours, but who knows what dangers lie inside? Will you choose to take the tunnel or the path?', 6, 15, 16),
('Sneak.mp3','Sneak.jpg', 'Aiko exhales slowly, his rage tempered by caution. He dismounts Barkley, tying the horse to a sturdy tree and stroking his mane to keep him calm. Drawing his father’s sword, he crouches low and begins to creep through the underbrush, his steps silent and deliberate. The first outlaw, the guard, murmurs something about needing food, slinging his repeater across his back and drawing a knife. Aiko cups his hands and mimics the call of a hare. The man perks up, muttering, “Dinner’s here,” as he moves toward the noise. He crouches at the bush Aiko hides within, knife ready, but his smirk fades when their eyes meet. Before the man can react, Aiko drives his blade upward, piercing through the man’s jaw and into his skull. He lowers the body into the brush, ensuring no noise betrays him. Moving silently, Aiko circles the camp, spotting the second outlaw hunched over a pile of stolen goods. The man’s attention is fixed on pocketing shiny trinkets. Aiko grabs a rock from the ground, creeping closer until he’s within striking distance. In one fluid motion, he bashes the man’s head and follows up with his sword, slashing his throat. The man collapses, gurgling as his blood soaks the ground. “Hey, Mikey? Shaun?” the drunken man by the fire slurs, glancing around in confusion. Aiko steps out from behind a stagecoach, his voice dripping with smugness. “They had to step out.” The drunk fumbles for his revolver, his shaky hands betraying his fear. Aiko fires, the bullet knocking the gun from the man’s grip. Panicking, the man scrambles toward a double-barrelled shotgun leaning against a nearby tree. Before he can reach it, Aiko hurls his sword, the blade impaling the man’s shoulder and pinning him to the tree. The man howls in agony, clawing weakly at the blade. Aiko strides up to him, drawing his revolver and pressing it to the man’s forehead. “Where’s David Jenkins?” he demands, his voice low and deadly. The man sneers, though his pain is evident. “I ain’t telling you nothin’,” he spits. Will you choose to kill him or spare him?', 7, 13, 14),

He spurs Barkley into a gallop, the horse’s hooves thundering against the earth as he barrels straight toward the camp. The outlaw standing guard barely has time to react before Aiko squeezes the trigger, a single shot dropping him where he stands. The others spring into action, bullets zipping through the air. Barkley lets out a shriek as rounds strike his flank, the impact making him rear violently. Aiko fights to maintain his seat, but the force of the buck throws him backward, slamming him to the ground. The world spins as he lands hard, his revolvers clattering out of reach. Before he can recover, he looks up to see the dark circle of a gun barrel aimed directly at his face. There’s no time to react, no plea that will save him. The muzzle flashes, and everything fades to black. You have died. The End.', 1, 1, 1),
('Kill.mp3','kill.jpg', '“Figured as much,” you mutter, pulling the trigger without hesitation. The man’s head jerks upward, a spray of red marking the bark behind him, before he slumps lifelessly against the tree. Birds scatter from the treetops, their startled cries breaking the silence, before the woods fall eerily quiet once more. Holstering your revolver with a fluid spin, you step around the tree, grip your sword’s hilt, and wrench it free. The blade comes out slick with blood, which you clean on the dead man’s tattered coat before sheathing it. Your gaze sweeps the camp as you search for anything of value. Near a dimly glowing lantern, you spot a weathered crate with a map pinned atop it. Moving closer, you pick it up, studying the crudely drawn lines. It shows the stages’ planned routes, leading to Silverbelly Creek, with markings indicating ambush spots. Running your finger along the map, you spot a scrawled note at the edge: "North Ridge—Final Gathering Point". A wicked grin crosses your face as you mutter, “Time to pay Mr. Jenkins a visit.” Returning to Barkley, you mount up and spur him into a gallop, taking a direct path toward the ridge.

I’ll tell you anything!" he stammers, desperation thick in his voice. Lowering your revolver slightly but keeping it ready, you step closer. "Start talking," you growl. "We were just packing the loot from those stages we hit on our way to the real target," he babbles, pointing shakily to a crate with a lantern and map atop it. "The rest of the gang’s holed up on the north ridge of Silverbelly, waiting for the right time." "Who’s the target?" you demand. "Castor. Benjamin Castor," the man blurts. "Some big-shot industrialist from back east—owns half the railroads, oil wells, and tobacco plantations. He’s heading to San Diego to make deals with the other rich tycoons. Jenkins plans to hit his stage, take the cargo, and ransom the man himself. Says it’s the score that’ll get us outta this godforsaken country before the east swallows it whole." He pauses, eyes darting between you and the revolver. "But I don’t care about none of that! I swear, mister, I’m done with all this. I’ll go straight, I promise!" With a sigh, you step forward and slam the butt of your revolver against his head. He crumples to the ground, unconscious. Retrieving your sword, you wipe it clean before approaching the crate.

Shadows dance across the jagged rock, and the occasional flutter of bat wings overhead sends a chill down your spine. The journey through the tunnel is uneventful but tense, the silence broken only by the clinking of your gear and the soft creak of your saddle. Finally, after what feels like an eternity, the faint glow of sunlight appears ahead. Emerging from the tunnel, you’re greeted by the breathtaking sight of Silverbelly Creek bathed in the colours of dusk. The sky is ablaze with hues of orange, pink, and purple, the reflection shimmering on the water below. The road resumes its winding path down toward the creek, a lone hawk soaring above the canyon.

The air grows still as you ride, the only sounds coming from Barkley’s steady steps and the occasional rustle of wind through the dry brush. As the road straightens, you come upon a covered wooden bridge spanning a narrow stream. The structure creaks in the gentle breeze, the aged timbers bearing the weight of years gone by. Halfway across, a figure emerges at the far end, hunched over and limping. He waves weakly, his voice frail. “Help me, sir… my horse threw me, and I’m in a bad way. Please… I need a doctor.” You slow Barkley, wary but unwilling to leave a man to die alone. As you near, the figure’s demeanour shifts. He straightens suddenly, drawing a pistol with practiced ease. “Hand over your horse and your goods, friend,” he sneers, his voice now sharp and mocking. Two more riders appear from the shadows behind him, bandanas masking their faces as their rifles glint in the fading light. Hoofbeats from behind reveal another pair closing off your retreat. You’re surrounded, trapped on the narrow bridge. The leader smirks, his English accent dripping with false politeness. “Now, if you cooperate, we might let you live. But if you resist... well, let’s just say we ain’t that kind of gentlemen.” You feel the weight of your father’s sword at your side, your revolvers within reach.

The echoes of gunfire fade into silence, the scent of gunpowder thick in the air. Dismounting, you check the bodies. These weren’t Jenkins’ men, just common outlaws who chose the wrong man to ambush.

Scattered tufts of sagebrush and the skeletal remains of ancient trees dot the landscape, casting long, distorted shadows that crawl across the sand. You dismount Barkley, who snorts softly and paws at the ground, sensing the tension in the air. Reaching for your binoculars, you scan the scene below. The trail path winds its way toward the creek, where chaos lies in full view. Two wagons and a stagecoach stand halted, their horses either dead or unhitched. The bodies of Pinkertons and Jenkins’ gang litter the ground, their lifeless forms sprawled like discarded dolls amidst the dust and carnage. Four gang members remain alive, loitering around the stagecoach. Two of them are busy loading sacks of gold and boxes of dynamite onto one of the wagons, their movements hurried and purposeful. A third thug struggles to pry open the stagecoach doors with a crowbar, cursing under his breath. Your heart quickens when your gaze falls on the fourth man—David Jenkins. He’s a tall figure with a wild, scruffy beard, his clothes finer than the others but dirtied with the grime of a fugitive’s life. He’s unloading gold from the trunk of the stage, moving with a calm that belies the chaos around him. This is it. Finally. You crouch low, retrieving your rifle from its scabbard on Barkley. With a practiced motion, you click the scope into place and rest the stock against your shoulder. Through the lens, the scene comes into sharp focus: Jenkins, the wagons, the dynamite—every detail is clear. Your breath slows as you consider your options. The explosive-laden wagon presents an opportunity to take out most of the gang in one decisive shot, but it risks losing the gold and evidence. On the other hand, a shot at Jenkins himself might bring his reign of terror to an end, but it’ll leave his lackeys free to scatter—and retaliate.

David Jenkins clings desperately to the back of the stage, dragged on his knees through the dirt, his shouts barely audible over the cacophony of the explosion and fleeing hooves. You charge into the fray, firing quick, deliberate shots. Another gang member drops as a bullet tears through his chest. Barkley leaps over the wreckage and bodies, his powerful strides closing the distance to the final outlaw. The last man struggles to his feet, reaching for his revolver. Before he can raise it, your shot finds its mark, drilling clean between his eyes. He collapses, his lifeless body hitting the ground with a dull thud. The scene is chaos incarnate. fire raging, bodies scattered, and the acrid stench of smoke and blood filling the air.

Jenkins flinches, his head snapping toward your position. “It’s that damn Rustwater bounty hunter!” he roars, his voice carrying through the canyon. Cursing under your breath, you sling the rifle over your back, mount Barkley, and spur him forward. The world becomes a blur as you charge down the ridge, bullets whizzing past your ears. "You know, O’Hanlon, it’s bad manners to show up uninvited!" Jenkins’ voice cuts through the chaos. "Lucky for you, you’re just in time for the fireworks!" The gang unleashes their barrage. Sticks of dynamite hurtle through the air, their fuses glowing like malevolent fireflies in the darkening sky. Thunderous explosions light up the desert behind you, sending waves of heat and dust in all directions. You fire back, your aim true. One of Jenkins’ men crumples from a shot to the chest, but not before he hurls another stick of dynamite, its fiery fuse spinning toward you. It lands ahead, bouncing once before settling. Your heart pounds as you yank the reins, trying to steer Barkley away, but there’s no time. For a moment, the world slows. You see the small cylinder bloom into an all-consuming inferno, a symphony of orange and yellow. The force of the blast throws you and Barkley into the air, weightless. And then, darkness. You have died. Game over.', 1, 1, 1),
('Standoff.mp3','Stage.jpg', 'The road winds downward into the entrance of the canyon, the jagged cliffs on either side casting long shadows as the last rays of sunlight fade. The wreckage of the stagecoach lies in the middle of the dirt path, its horses grazing nervously nearby, their reins tangled in broken harnesses. You slow Barkley to a trot, scanning the scene for signs of life. There’s no immediate sign of Jenkins. As you approach, you hear a voice from inside the battered coach. “Hey, you there, sir,” a man calls, his tone refined, his accent distinctly upper crust. You look up to see his eyes glinting through a narrow slit in the armoured door. “May I offer you a proposition?” You slide off your saddle, landing softly on the ground, your boots crunching against the gravel. Adjusting your hat, you approach cautiously, keeping your hand near your revolver. “I’m listening,” you reply, your curiosity piqued. “I’ll give you a hundred dollars to rid me of these degenerates,” he says, his words polite yet dripping with disdain. A small smirk crosses your face as you respond, “Consider it done. Most of them won’t be bothering anyone anymore.” Before the man inside can reply, a gravelly voice cuts through the tense air. “Not all of them, son.” You whip around to see David Jenkins limping out from behind the trunk of the stagecoach. His weathered face is a mask of defiance, streaked with sweat and dirt. Blood drips from a fresh wound on his leg, but his revolver remains steady in his hand. You instinctively step back, your fingers inching closer to your holster. The two of you lock eyes, and for a moment, the world seems to hold its breath. “So this is him,” Jenkins growls, his tone dripping with disdain. “The mighty Ike O’Hanlon. I gotta say, I’ve heard a lot of stories from my boys. You’ve been a real thorn in my side. If I’m being honest, though, you’re a lot less Irish than I was expecting.” He chuckles bitterly, shaking his head. He gestures toward the coach with his gun. “You know, this here was gonna be our big ticket out of this hellhole. That man in there was our prize. Our freedom.” He spits on the ground, his frustration palpable. “But you... you just had to come along and ruin everything.” You tilt your head slightly, your voice calm but sharp. “And holding a man for ransom was your grand plan? You thought that was the way out?” Jenkins’ face hardens, his voice rising with anger. “Don’t preach to me, bounty hunter. That man in there—he makes me look like a saint. At least I got a code. Him? He’s just a no-good son of a-”', 10, 21, 22),
('AikoShoots.mp3','aikshoot.jpg', 'Bang! In one fluid motion, you draw your revolver and fire. The slug finds its mark between Jenkins’ eyes, the shot echoing off the canyon walls. His anger is frozen in that split second—mouth agape, eyes wide—as he drops to his knees, then collapses face-first into the dust. The air holds its breath, stunned at the sudden violence. Jenkins is finished. A hush settles over the desert canyon, the wind rustling dried sagebrush as though exhaling relief. Slowly, the battered stagecoach door creaks open, and a well-dressed man in a pristine grey suit steps out, wielding a double-barrelled shotgun. You whip around, revolver still hot in your grasp, aiming straight for his chest. He levels the shotgun at you, but the two of you lock eyes—each reading the other’s intentions—and both weapons lower. Your boots scrape against the gravel as you take a cautious step forward. The man mirrors your movement, his polished shoes scattering dust across the sunbaked ground. You keep your hand near your holster, every muscle coiled. “And you are?” you ask, your voice echoing in the stillness, carrying a tension that the man does not miss. His brow quirks, and he inclines his head ever so slightly, a measured respect in his posture.', 11, 27, 27),
('castorshoot.mp3', 'castorshoot.jpg','The stagecoach door suddenly bursts open with a thunderous clang. Before either of you can react, a well-dressed man in a sharp grey suit steps out, wielding a double-barrelled shotgun. Boom! The deafening shot echoes through the canyon as Jenkins’ head snaps back, a crimson spray painting the dirt behind him. His body crumples lifelessly to the ground, his revolver slipping from his hand. You instinctively raise your weapon but stop short as the man lowers the shotgun, smoke curling from its barrels. His face is calm, almost detached, as he brushes dust from his lapel. “Apologies for the mess,” he says coolly, his voice steady and cultured. “I’ve never been one for theatrics.” You glance at him warily, still gripping your revolver.', 11, 27, 27),
('NoOffer.mp3','refuseCastor.jpg', 'You shake your head, your resolve firm. "No, Mr. Castor. I’m not for hire." Castor raises an eyebrow, his polite demeanour faltering for a moment. “A pity,” he muses. “David mentioned you hail from Rust Water.” The name makes you pause. “What of it?” you ask, your tone guarded. “I regret to inform you,” Castor says, adjusting his cufflinks, “the mayor has placed your town up for auction. A mining company is looking to turn the place into a full-blown operation. The papers have already been signed.” Your stomach tightens at the news. Rust Water—the place where you grew up, where the people have scraped by for decades—is being sold off to the highest bidder. Castor notices your reaction and presses on. “This shipment I’m transporting. The payout from it would more than cover the town’s purchase price. With your help, I could ensure that money finds its way into the right hands—your hands.” You hesitate, the weight of the decision pressing down on you. Rust Water’s people deserved a chance. After a long pause, you sigh and nod. "Fine. I’ll do it—for the town." Castor adjusts his hat and steps back toward the stagecoach. “Then it’s settled. Welcome aboard.” Thank you for playing this demo.', 1, 1, 1),

I’ll do it.” He smiles, satisfied. “Wise choice.” As the first light of dawn begins to crest over the canyon walls, you draw the wakizashi from your back, the blade gleaming in the soft glow of the rising sun. You stare at it for a moment, reflecting on everything that’s led you to this moment. With a deep breath, you sheath the blade and turn to face Castor. “Let’s get this done,” you say, a steely determination in your voice.

('castorCONT.mp3','talkCastor.jpg', 'The man extends a hand. “Benjamin Castor,” he introduces himself, a faint smile playing at the corners of his mouth. “I believe I owe you my thanks for your... timely intervention.” You nod, but your eyes narrow as you size him up. The tailored suit, the confident demeanour—this wasn’t a man used to being in anyone’s debt. Castor’s gaze shifts to the blade strapped to your back. “An interesting weapon for a bounty hunter,” he remarks. “Tell me, do you speak Japanese?” You pause before answering. “I do.” His smile widens slightly, a glint of opportunity in his eyes. “Excellent. You see, I’m on my way to finalize a trade agreement with the Japanese government. A shipment of Civil War rifles in exchange for certain... resources of mutual interest. However, I find myself in need of capable guns for hire, as well as someone fluent in the language to smooth over any misunderstandings.” You tilt your head, intrigued. “And what’s the pay?” “Generous,” he replies without hesitation. “Far more than a hundred dollars, I assure you.” The canyon grows quiet, save for the distant rustle of wind through the cliffs. You glance down at Jenkins’ lifeless body, then back at Castor. Will you accept his offer? Yes or No.', 11, 23, 24),

You exhale slowly and squeeze the trigger. Bang! The bullet pierces one of the crates, igniting its deadly cargo. The wagon erupts into a ferocious bloom of fire, the explosion consuming the man atop it in an instant. The second man is launched off his feet, crashing to the ground like a ragdoll. You stare at the flames, reminding you of the fire at chaos that took everything from a little boy so many years ago, you look down at your hand, still scarred from the burns of that fire, and a long dormant rage within you begins to spark again.  With the chaos unfolding below, you lean forward in the saddle, the Katana pressing reassuringly against your back as you ride hard down the ridge. The stagecoach’s horses rear in panic, breaking free and bolting down the trail with the coach in tow. David Jenkins clings desperately to the back of the stage, dragged on his knees through the dirt, his shouts barely audible over the cacophony of the explosion and fleeing hooves. You charge into the fray, firing quick, deliberate shots. Another gang member drops as a bullet tears through his chest. Barkley leaps over the wreckage and bodies, his powerful strides closing the distance to the final outlaw. The last man struggles to his feet, reaching for his revolver. Before he can raise it, your shot finds its mark, drilling clean between his eyes. He collapses, his lifeless body hitting the ground with a dull thud. The scene is chaos incarnate. fire raging, bodies scattered, and the acrid stench of smoke and blood filling the air. You glance down the road, spotting the runaway stagecoach in the distance, Jenkins still clinging on for dear life. "Only one left," you mutter, rearing Barkley to charge after the stage.
